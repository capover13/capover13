            <p>The Coast Guard confirmed that the missing Titan submersible likely imploded.

                <p>Officials discovered several pieces of debris near the site of the Titanic shipwreck.</p>
                
                <p>The vessel appears to have suffered a "catastrophic loss of the pressure chamber," officials said.</p>
                
                <p>The Titan submersible appears to have had a "catastrophic loss of the pressure chamber," imploding in the ocean's depths and shattering its debris 1,600 feet away from the famous shipwreck its five passengers hoped to explore, the Coast Guard said.</p>
                
                <p>Officials offered a Thursday afternoon update on the submersible, which disappeared on Sunday during an exploratory dive of the Titanic wreck prompting an extensive search and rescue operation that has now been called off.</p>
                
                <p>"We are grateful for the rapid mobilization of experts on the undersea search and rescue, and we thank all of the agencies and personnel for their role in the response," US Coast Guard Rear Admiral John Mauger said during the Thursday news conference.</p>
                
                <p>OceanGate, the marine exploration company that operated the vessel, said Thursday that the five passengers onboard the Titan are presumed dead.</p>
                
                <p>Coast Guard officials said it notified the passengers' families after a remotely operated vehicle, or ROV, discovered a tail comb of the Titan approximately 1,600 feet from the bow of the Titanic, which lies about 12,500 feet beneath the surface, as well as additional debris that is consistent with a loss of cabin pressure that would have triggered the vessel to implode.</p>
                
                <p>Mauger added that investigators discovered five major pieces of debris confirmed to be the remains of the Titan, including a nose comb from outside of the pressure hull, the front of the pressure hull, and eventually, the totality of the pressure vessel.</p>
                
                <p>ROVs will remain on the scene, which is more than two miles beneath the surface, to continue investigating what went wrong and gather more information, officials said.</p>
                
                <p>"This is an incredibly complex case and we're still working to develop the details for the timeline involved with this casualty and the response," Mauger said.</p>
                
                <p>Mauger said it was too early to tell if the implosion happened at the same moment that the sub lost contact with its mothership, which happened about one hour and 45 minutes after launch; buoys deployed to search for the missing vessel hours after it went missing did not detect the implosion, according to the Coast Guard, suggesting the disaster likely occurred before the search began.</p>
                
                <p>Stefan Williams, a professor of marine robotics at the University of Sydney whose lab works with unscrewed submersibles, told Insider earlier this week that such an implosion could be due to a leak, power failure, or small fire from an electrical short circuit.</p>
                
                <p>"It would happen quite quickly and there would be little chance of surviving," he said.</p>
